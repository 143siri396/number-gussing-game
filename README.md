# number-guessing-game
 It is a simple interactive Python program where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback to the user (e.g., "too high" or "too low") after each guess, guiding them towards the correct number. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game ends and shows the number of attempts taken.
